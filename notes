use nice -n19 perfer when on same machine

- log.c and queue.c
 - benchmark on shorty again

- remote cluster
 - worker server
  - connect, maybe with some kind of security
  - server feeds to worker
   - as packets arrive from con
    - needs to attach a connection id to each packet
    - worker reassemples
   - or create packet on server and pick a worker to sent it to
    - maybe based on how many outstanding to that worker and most recent latency
     - multiple and pick lowest
    - packet is con id + len + request

- action cable

 - implement spec using actioncable
  - middleware to grab env[upgrade] and then make the actioncable calls
  - maybe set up explicit channel for the connection
  
 - maybe we can expand spec to include pub-sub since ac uses it
